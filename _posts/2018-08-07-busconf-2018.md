I love unconferences. The dynamics and the feeling is quite different from "normal" conferences. They tend to be quite unassuming in regards to the people or the talks. And I do love that some of the sessions are just people asking for someone to help them understand concepts or tools.

I just attended [Busconf](http://www.bus-conf.org/index.html), which is a Functional Programming Unconference in its second year. And the experience has been greatly satisfying.

### First, 
the location, at the SeminarZentrum in Rückersbach, a bit outside of Frankfurt, is an incredible and beautiful choice (if you want to have a view through google maps you can see it [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.0437687,9.1096571,3a,89.6y,323.65h,102.32t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPlVnBMK25MFA_-Sx1xjU050WdCOwQ-_bd69C4-!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPlVnBMK25MFA_-Sx1xjU050WdCOwQ-_bd69C4-%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya167.02386-ro0-fo100!7i9728!8i4080)). I was even surprised that taxis would go over there. But to achieve a sense of community, is just perfect. There is nothing else to do but to mingle with the rest of the attendees. And I leave having met lots of interesting people.

### Second,
the talks where very informative and enjoyable:

[Tom Harding](https://github.com/i-am-tom) and [Justin Woo](https://github.com/justinwoo) did some talks around Purescript that actually made want to do some frontend (I am one of those people that don't like much neither JS the language nor the ecosystem). 

[Christopher Welcz](https://twitter.com/ChristophWelcz) did a fantastic work with his presentation of functional programming in Java using Vavr. I have used that library before, and he has actually taken away some of my misgivings about it.

One of the greatest thing about unconferences, as mentioned earlier, is that sometimes a session is someone with an itch asking for who can scratch it. In that vein there was an entertaining discussion about finding the pros and cons of Elm, instantiated by [Nicole Rauch](https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch). One con (for some people a pro) that I thing we forgot was that Elm is very opinionated (The Elm Architecture). There was another session like it for Haskell on the real word, alas! I missed that one.

### Of course,
not everything was perfect. With the hot weather currently afflicting Europe, the SeminarZentrum wasn't really prepared for the high temperatures (over 30C). But I don't think that is what you usually get on that area. And I had a nightmare Thursday getting there: I did manage first to get the wrong train to the airport, and then realize that I was on the wrong airport ... Go me.

But it was a great experience that I am looking forward to repeat next year.

I want to give some thanks to [Marco Emrich](https://twitter.com/marcoemrich) for convincing me to cofacilitate a session around Functional Calisthenics and for bringing some board games so we could play, and to [Rabea Gleissner](https://twitter.com/aebaR) and [Uğurcan Şengit](https://twitter.com/urgucansengit) for the session about Apprenticeships (happily suggested by [Wolfram Kriesing](https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing)).

Finally thanks to [Toby Pflug](https://twitter.com/tpflug) and [Nicole Rauch](https://twitter.com/nicolerauch) for organizing the event.
